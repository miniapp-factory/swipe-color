+🌈 GAMEPLAY BASICS
+Swipe to connect 3 or more matching color blocks:
+
+
+3 matching colors → Blocks disappear, earning points and clearing space.
+
+
+4 matching colors → Creates a Combo Block, which explodes in a small radius when matched.
+
+
+5 matching colors → Creates a Special Skill Block.
+
+
+When activated, this block targets all blocks of its color across the whole board, clearing massive areas and generating huge combos!
+
+
+
+
+💥 SPECIAL SKILL BLOCK TYPES
+
+
+Red Burst – Clears all red blocks instantly.
+
+
+Blue Wave – Sweeps an entire row and column.
+
+
+Green Storm – Creates chain reactions by converting random blocks to green before clearing them.
+
+
+Yellow Pulse – Adds extra moves and clears yellow blocks.
+
+
+Purple Flash – Creates lightning arcs hitting random spots on the board.
+
+
+🧩 LEVEL PROGRESSION
+The game features hundreds of levels, each more challenging than the last.
+As you progress, you’ll encounter:
+
+
+Blockers (ice, stone, vines)
+
+
+Limited moves
+
+
+Timed levels
+
+
+Collect-the-color missions
+
+
+Break-the-jelly tiles
+
+
+Falling items to rescue
+
+
+Multi-layer tiles
+
+
+Locked blocks that only open with combos
+
+
+Each chapter introduces new mechanics, tougher puzzles, and fresh visuals to keep the gameplay exciting.
+🌟 LEVEL DIFFICULTY SYSTEM
+
+
+Level 1–20: Simple matching, introduces 4-match combos
+
+
+Level 21–50: Introduces blockers (ice, crates)
+
+
+Level 51–100: Multi-layer tiles and limited-move objectives
+
+
+Level 101–200: Timed levels, bombs, chain reactions
+
+
+Level 200+: Complex board layouts, portals, color shifters, advanced blockers
+
+
+🎯 WIN CONDITIONS

+
+
+Collect X number of specific color blocks
+
+
+Break all blockers
+
+
+Drop special items to the bottom
+
+
+Clear jelly tiles
+
+
+Reach a target score
+
+
+Defeat “boss blockers” by using combos
+
+
+⚡ COMBO SYSTEM
+Mix special blocks for huge effects:
+
+
+Combo + Combo → bigger explosion
+
+
+Skill Block + Combo → wipes half the board
+
+
+Skill Block + Skill Block → Mega Burst, clearing the entire board and reshuffling it with bonus points
+
+
+

+✅ Level map design
+✅ Shop system with power-ups
+✅ Actual game code (in Java, JavaScript, C#, Godot, Unity, etc.)
